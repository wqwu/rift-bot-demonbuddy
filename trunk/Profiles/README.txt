====>Rift Bot Common
Leave rift once boss is killed or town stone found. Will not explore the current level if town stone found unless it is the first level.

====>Rift Bot Explore
Leave rift once boss is killed. Will explore the last level if town stone found before boss spawns. Set gold inactivity timer!

====>Rift Bot Full
Keeps exploring the rift after boss is killed until town stone is found. If the boss is not spawned after the last level is fully explored, the bot will teleport out and leave the game to start a new one.
